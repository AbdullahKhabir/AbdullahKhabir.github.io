      <description>Port Forwarding Techniques With Rinetd I have three machines in this lab:
My Arch Linux host (can connect to internet) My Kali VM (can connect to internet as well) OpenBSD VM (can&amp;rsquo;t connect to internet) So I have compromised kali vm, and from that machine I have access to OpenBSD vm now. And OpenBSD vm isn&amp;rsquo;t connected to internet. Even I can&amp;rsquo;t ping to my arch linux host from that vm.</description>

Macros can save you time by performing tasks that would otherwise need to be done manually, such as formatting text or tables, performing searches, or replacing text. You can create macros in Word by using the Macro Recorder or by writing VBA code.</description>

      <description>Information Gethering Get the information about the application, what it does, how it works, which language it is written in? Which server software is the application running on?
Our goal of every attack or exploit is to increase our permissions within the application or pivot to another application or target.

      <description>How vulnerability scanners work? Detect if target is up and running. Conduct a full or partial port scan. Identify running OS using common fingerprinting techniques. Identify running services with common techniques such as banner grabbing, service behavior identification or file discovery. Execute a signature-matching process to discover vulnerabilities. ⚠️ Some vulnerability scanners can be configured to exploit a vulnerability upon detection. This might crash the service so please check scanners options carefully.</description>

      <description>Passive Information Gathering also known as OSINT (open source intelligence) is process of collecting openly available information about a target without any direct interaction with that target.
Website recon if a client has a website, get basic infos by browsing the site. check about page to get email addresses and other social media accounts. check email addresses format. Like if the employees use their first name and last name in addresses.</description>
