      <description>Metasploit Framework Metasploit Framework is a widely-used, open-source platform for developing, testing, and executing exploit code against target systems. It provides a comprehensive framework for penetration testing and vulnerability assessment, with a large library of pre-built exploits, payloads, and tools that can be used to identify and exploit vulnerabilities in target systems.
The Metasploit Framework includes a command-line interface (CLI) as well as a graphical user interface (GUI) that allows users to interact with the framework, run scans and penetration tests, and generate reports.</description>

      <title>Port Forwarding</title>

      <description>What&amp;rsquo;s Port-Forwarding? In penetration testing, port forwarding can be used to facilitate access to internal network resources that would otherwise be inaccessible from outside the network.
For example, if a penetration tester has gained access to a device on the internal network and wants to access resources on other devices within the network, they may use port forwarding to create a tunnel between the internal network and their own device.</description>

      <description>Client Side attacks for Windows MS Word macros A Microsoft Word macro is a set of instructions or actions that you can record or write in Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) to automate repetitive tasks in Word. Macros can save you time by performing tasks that would otherwise need to be done manually, such as formatting text or tables, performing searches, or replacing text. You can create macros in Word by using the Macro Recorder or by writing VBA code.</description>

      <description>Information Gethering Get the information about the application, what it does, how it works, which language it is written in? Which server software is the application running on?
Our goal of every attack or exploit is to increase our permissions within the application or pivot to another application or target.

      <title>Vulnerability Scanning</title>

      <guid>https://abdullah.solutions/pentesting/vulnerability-scanning/</guid>
      <description>How vulnerability scanners work? Detect if target is up and running. Conduct a full or partial port scan. Identify running OS using common fingerprinting techniques. Identify running services with common techniques such as banner grabbing, service behavior identification or file discovery. Execute a signature-matching process to discover vulnerabilities. ⚠️ Some vulnerability scanners can be configured to exploit a vulnerability upon detection. This might crash the service so please check scanners options carefully.</description>

      <description>Active Information Gathering involves direct interaction with target services.
DNS Enumeration DNS is one of the most critical system on the internet and is distributed database responsible for translating
user-friendly domain names into IP addresses.
How DNS works? Lets take a closer look at the process and servers involved in resolving a hostname like abdullah.solutions.
The process starts when a hostname is entered into a browser or other application. The browser passes the hostname to</description>

      <description>Passive Information Gathering also known as OSINT (open source intelligence) is process of collecting openly available information about a target without any direct interaction with that target.
Website recon if a client has a website, get basic infos by browsing the site. check about page to get email addresses and other social media accounts. check email addresses format. Like if the employees use their first name and last name in addresses.</description>
